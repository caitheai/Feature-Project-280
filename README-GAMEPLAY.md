# THIS IS FOR TESTERS / TEACHERS

Please read this for how exactly to test
all of the gameplay in this demon

NOTICE: I used a few unreal engine plugins to make
this project, so idk if you'll need to download
those to open the project in the editor??

NOTICE 2: The flee and act mechanics are not in this
since it is only a demo made to display combat function
