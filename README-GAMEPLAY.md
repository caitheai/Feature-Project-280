# THIS IS FOR TESTERS / TEACHERS

Please read this for how exactly to test
all of the gameplay in this demon

NOTICE: I used a few unreal engine plugins to make
this project, so idk if you'll need to download
those to open the project in the editor??

NOTICE 2: The flee and act mechanics are not in this
since it is only a demo made to display combat function


Keybinds:
WASD to move
W/S to move up and down in action menu
Enter to interact


How to Play:
Control the character and move to the end of the platform,
get close to the enemy to initiate a battle, then
either win or die!
