# CAGD 280 Fall Semester Final Project

This project is to a final for me to show what I've
learned all year and put that to a game project

This project will be recreating a 2d RPG battle
(This oldschool pokemon / earthbound games)

This project will be made in Unreal Engine

All the coding was done by me, Cai
All the sprites were made by my friend Ian,
who made them specifically for this project
and are fine with their use

All Music was made by friends exclusively for this project as well
All sound effects are free and open source and were found online
